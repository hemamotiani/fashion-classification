## Abstract

This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based fashion classification system using the Fashion Small dataset and an outfit recommender using the Polyvore dataset. The classification model will identify different clothing categories, while the recommender system will suggest outfit combinations based on fashion compatibility. The project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and similarity-based models for outfit recommendation.

All code is contained in the Jupyter Notebook: `fashionSmall.ipynb`.
