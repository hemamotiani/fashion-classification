## üßæ Project Overview
This project classifies fashion images into 20 high-level clothing categories using a deep learning model built on top of EfficientNet. The dataset, originally consisting of 50 categories, is preprocessed, reorganized, and split into training and testing sets for robust model training and evaluation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Run Instructions

### 1. Clone this repository and mount Google Drive
This project is designed for use in Google Colab.

All code is contained in the Jupyter Notebook: `Deepfashion.ipynb`.

## Contents

- Python code to download, prepare, and load the data  
- Python code for a baseline neural network model  
- Python code to train the model  
- Python code to evaluate the model on a separate test set  
- This README file with instructions to run the code  

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required libraries:
   pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
3. Download the dataset at https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7EVK8r0v71pa2EyNEJ0dE9zbU0/view?usp=drive_link&resourcekey=0-CPiKS-AiE8IDonk54WJ5_w and add it to your google drive.
4. Open the Jupyter notebook and run cells from top to bottom
